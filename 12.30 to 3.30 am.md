### Research Paper Algo 1: 

This pseudo code outlines the process for **early network intrusion detection** using a combination of **graph embeddings** and a **Random Forest classifier (RF)**. Here’s a detailed explanation of each step in the context of **graph-based intrusion detection**:
**Input and Initialization:**

1. **Input**: A **pcap file** (packet capture file) with **m flows**.

• A **pcap file** is a network capture file that stores network traffic data. Each **flow** represents a sequence of packets exchanged between two endpoints (e.g., source and destination IP addresses, ports, etc.).

2. **Initialize**:

• **G**: An empty set to store the graphs corresponding to each flow.

• **E**: An empty set to store the **embedded representations** of each flow’s graph.

  

**Step 2-6: Building Graph Representations for Each Flow**

  

3. **Loop over each flow (from 0 to m)**:

• For each flow  i , you extract the **packet length sequence** from the pcap file.

• **Packet length sequence** refers to the sequence of packet sizes in the flow, which will serve as the key features for graph construction.

4. **Construct the graph for flow**  i :

• A graph **G** is constructed based on the extracted **packet length sequence**. This graph can be thought of as capturing relationships or patterns within the flow’s packets. For example, you could represent packets as nodes, and the edges might represent transitions between packets or similarities in packet lengths.

5. **Add the constructed graph to the set G**:

• The graph created for flow  i  is added to the collection **G**, which will eventually contain the graph representations for all  m  flows in the pcap file.

  

**Step 7-10: Embedding the Graph Representations**

  

6. **For each graph in G**:

• The code loops through each graph **G_i** (representing a flow), and for each graph:

7. **GetWLsubgraph(G_i)**:

• This step extracts a **subgraph** or a **local neighborhood** around certain nodes (packets) from the original graph **G_i**. The **WL (Weisfeiler-Lehman) subgraph** is a technique used for graph isomorphism and to capture local patterns within the graph, potentially identifying unusual behavior that could indicate an intrusion.

8. **Learn embedded representation of the graph using subgraphs**:

• After extracting the subgraph, an **embedding model** (like **Graph2Vec**) is used to generate a **vector representation** of the graph. This embedding captures the overall structure of the graph, encoding information about packet lengths, transitions, and other graph characteristics that may be useful for intrusion detection.
**Step 11: Save Embedded Representations**

9. **Save the embeddings to E**:

• The embedded representation of each graph  G_i  (stored in the set **E**) is saved. These embeddings serve as a condensed version of the graph’s structure, and they will be used as features for the intrusion detection classifier.

**Step 12-13: Classification and Output**

10. **Input the embeddings into a Random Forest Classifier (RF)**:

• The set of graph embeddings **E** is then fed into a **Random Forest classifier**. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make a final prediction.

• In this case, the classifier is trained to detect network intrusions. The embeddings provide a compact yet informative representation of the flow, which the Random Forest model uses to classify whether the flow is normal or malicious.

11. **Return the detection result**:

• The result of the classification is returned. This could be a binary classification (e.g., “Normal” or “Intrusion”) or multi-class depending on the type of intrusion detection system being implemented.

**Context of Graph-Embedded Intrusion Detection:**

  

In **early intrusion detection**:

• **Graph embedding** techniques like **graph2vec** are used to learn **graph representations** of network traffic. These representations capture patterns in packet sequences, which might help in identifying anomalies early (before a full attack is launched or detected via traditional methods).

• The **Random Forest classifier** is trained on these embeddings to classify the traffic, making it an effective tool for **real-time detection** and **preemptive responses** to potential threats.

  

By **embedding** flow graphs into vector representations, the method can detect patterns that might indicate **early-stage** intrusions. These could be subtle anomalies in packet size, flow timing, or sequence, which may not be immediately noticeable in traditional monitoring systems.

  

In summary, this pseudo-code provides a pipeline for **early intrusion detection** by:

1. **Constructing graph representations** of network flows based on packet length sequences.

2. **Learning embeddings** of these graphs to capture flow behavior.

3. Using these embeddings as input to a **Random Forest classifier** to detect anomalies and classify network traffic as either **normal** or **malicious**.
